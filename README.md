# DeKUT Mobile GIS Navigation App

## Project Summary

Mobile-first GIS navigation application developed for Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT).
The project integrates geospatial data pipelines, cloud-hosted spatial databases, and AI-assisted development to deliver a modern campus navigation system.

The application is designed for scalability, intelligence, and real-world GIS workflows.

## Core Features

- Interactive campus map
- Visualization of buildings, roads, and landmarks
- Mobile-friendly user interface
- Cloud-based spatial data storage
- Modular and scalable system architecture

---

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- Mobile-first UI design
- Web mapping using Leaflet or Mapbox

### Data and Backend

- Overpass API for OpenStreetMap data extraction
- Python for data processing and automation
- Supabase PostgreSQL backend
- Spatial data modeling

### Development Tools

- Git and GitHub for version control

---

## Spatial Data Pipeline

- Data Extraction
  - OpenStreetMap data extracted using Overpass API
- Data Processing
  - Python used to clean, structure, and validate spatial data
- Spatial Database
  - Data uploaded and managed in Supabase using a PostgreSQL-based backend
  - Structured to support spatial queries and future routing logic
- Application Layer
  - Map rendering and user interaction
  - API-ready design for backend expansion

---

## AI-Driven Development Approach

AI tools were actively used throughout development to:

- Diagnose and resolve coding and logic errors
- Optimize data handling and application workflows
- Assist in designing efficient spatial data structures
- Improve code quality and documentation

AI acted as a development accelerator and technical assistant, enabling faster iteration and higher-quality system design while all final decisions and implementations remained under developer control.
